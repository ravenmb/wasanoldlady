  <p>The assignment for my Web Authoring class at CSU East Bay was to create a long scrolling<br />
  webpage at least 10,000 pixels long. During a brainstorming session I thought of telling<br />
  a children's story where the elements of the story built upon one another. <i>There Was<br />
  An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly</i> came to mind and I thought it had potential. Then I<br />
  sketched an evil looking old woman with her mouth stretched open impossibly wide and I<br />
  knew this was what I wanted to do.</p>

  <p>The biggest challenge was getting all the elements to appear and disappear at the right moments<br />
  while scrolling. Once all the parts of the story worked correctly, I decided to add a "tally"<br />
  of the animals she had already eaten that would fly in from the side.</p>

  <p>I am a Graphic Design Major and plan to graduate in Spring 2019.<br />
